**Minecraft-inspired 3D Block Game**

A simple 3D block-building game inspired by the popular sandbox title “Minecraft”.  
Built primarily using HTML and CSS, this project demonstrates 3D rendering, block placement and simple interaction through web technologies.

## 🧱 Features

- 3D blocks rendered in a browser (using CSS transforms / 3D space)  
- Block placement / removal mechanics (basic)  
- A movable camera/viewpoint allowing the user to “look around” the 3D space  
- Simple world / grid made up of blocks  
- Lightweight structure: no heavy engine or external framework required  

## 📁 Repository Structure

```

├── minecraft.html   – the main HTML entry point
├── stylesheet.css   – styling and 3D block rendering logic
└── … (additional assets / scripts)

````

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Himesh-2007/Minecraft.git
````

2. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   cd Minecraft
   ```
3. Open `minecraft.html` in your web browser

   * Double-click the file, or
   * Serve it via a local HTTP server for better compatibility (e.g., `python -m http.server` and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/minecraft.html`)
4. Use your mouse/keyboard (if supported) to move the camera, look around, and add/remove blocks.

## ✅ Compatibility & Requirements

* A modern web browser with support for CSS 3D transforms (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
* No server-side backend required; this is a purely client-side experience
* Works offline once downloaded

## 🧠 Potential Improvements

* Improve physics / gravity (blocks fall, player jumps)
* Add textures, lighting/shading to give more realistic visuals
* Build a block-type registry (wood, stone, sand, water…)
* Save/Load world state (via localStorage or a backend)
* Improve performance for large block counts
* Mobile/touch support
